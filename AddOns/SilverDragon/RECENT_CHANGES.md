## Changed in v2024.11

* Add some tracking of the server shard you've seen a mob in
    * Currently only expresses itself as an option to show/dim/hide mobs from other shards in the history frame
    * In the future this will probably make its way into the announcement options so e.g. notifications from guild members will be more relevant
* Allow resizing of the history frame
* Allow right-clicking on an item in the history frame to remove just it
* DarkMagic: avoid an error that could happen if you chose to suppress other errors (meta!)
* Prep for some API deprecations in 11.0.2
