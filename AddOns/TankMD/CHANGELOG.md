[Full Changelog](https://github.com/Oppzippy/TankMD/compare/v3.0.4...v3.1.0) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/Oppzippy/TankMD/releases)

- Fix luals LibStub type being overridden by test stub  
- Add .vscode to .gitignore  
- Added support for Paladin's Blessing of Freedom (#17)  
    As mentioned in this post [1].  
    In the Mythic+ dungeon, the Retribution Paladin often needs to cast  
    Blessing of Freedom on the tank to ensure that the tank does not need  
    to run around.  
    For example, when the Entangled Affix is triggered, or when the monster  
    is casting such skills [2].  
    In addition, when the tank is gathering monsters, the Retribution  
    Paladin will also cast Blessing of Freedom on the tank. Because when the  
    Unbound Freedom talent is selected, Blessing of Freedom has a speed-up  
    effect, which is beneficial for the tank to gather monsters.
