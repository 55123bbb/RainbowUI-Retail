[Full Changelog](https://github.com/Cidan/BetterBags/compare/v0.1.66...v0.1.67) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/Cidan/BetterBags/releases)

- Fixes for Bank and Errors (#440)  
    * Fixed a bug where the bank would not update sometimes.  
- Fixed a bug where items would go dark when interacting with sands, xmog, etc.  
- Themed the elvui search box.  
- Themed Icons (#438)  
    * Changed default columns and rows for grid view on new installs to be 7 items per row, 2 columns.  
    * Fixed bags shifting position on load.  
    * Icons are now slightly better spaced out in the main grid.  
    * Themes can now apply icon decorations just like they can the bags, without the need to disable Masque or any other addon. Themes can switch out item icons without a reload.  
    * ElvUI theme has been updated to also apply the ElvUI look to the item buttons.
