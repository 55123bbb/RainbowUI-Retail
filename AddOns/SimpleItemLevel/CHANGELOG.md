[Full Changelog](https://github.com/kemayo/wow-simpleitemlevel/compare/v36...v37) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/kemayo/wow-simpleitemlevel/releases)

- Update Baganator API usage  
    It has tri-state returns now, so anywhere I was just returning nil was  
    causing a performance issue.  
    Fixes #44  
- Remove Wrath TOC - no longer applies with the deprecated calls removed
